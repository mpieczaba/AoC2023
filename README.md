# Advent of Code 2023

**Hacks that helped me solve some of the AoC 2023 challenges.**

## üöÄ Running the code

1. Make sure you have installed [Go](https://go.dev/) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/)).
2. Clone this repository:
    ```zsh
    $ git clone https://github.com/mpieczaba/AoC2023.git && cd AoC2023
    ```
3. Run your desired day:
    ```zsh
    $ go run ./day<day number>/day<day number>.go 
    ```
    or
    ```zsh
    $ rustc ./day<day number>/day<day number>.rs; ./day<day number>/day<day number>
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This code is very bad. 

I didn't have much time to solve these problems right so most of them are my brute-force approaches, occasionally commented and further explained.  

I try to solve most of my problems with Kent Beck's methodology: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." Well, it works but deep inside it's really nasty.
